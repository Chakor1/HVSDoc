# Install and configure HVS on Redhat

You can install and configure HVS on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux OS. Follow the instructions to create a High Availability (HA) infrastructure with multiple application servers. Configure unique HTTPS ports for managing all the HTTPS protocol from a single HAProxy server in addition to the standard port 443.

> Note: Based on your organization, you must open the firewall for the unique HTTPS ports.

With this kind of installation, users can access HVS from a web browser of a client PC
through HAProxy but cannot access any HVS system directly.
