You can visualize integrated data from multiple sources using the map view. Map enables you
to view every entity related to events, inspections, incidents, and objects in real-time.
By default, HVS is configured to use Google Maps. However, it supports other custom map
configurations as well. Contact your administrator for more information.
Map displays the available entities in the left pane. Each entity is categorized based on the
entity type. For example, Objects lists the stationary and camera related entities. When you
click the camera entity, HVS displays the map markers related to all cameras on the map. To
remove the map markers from the map view, click camera again.
You can use the left pane to filter the map markers on the map view. To get quick information
about an entity in the InfoWindow, click the map marker.
